Mongoose - DOM
    Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

    Firstly, make sure you have MongoDB and nodejs installed.

    Let's install mongoose by the following command line using npm :
        $ npm install mongoose --save

    In this "mongoose_learning" project, I'm going to make 12 parts followed by mongoosejs.com :

        7. Queries
        8. Validation
